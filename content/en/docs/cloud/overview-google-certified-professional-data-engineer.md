A few days ago I thought about the experience in cloud environment that I have accumulated in the last 5 years. I have been working indistinctly in GCP and AWS environments, getting familiar with different services or applications that make your day to day life easier. As a Data Scientist, these services allow you to deploy small MVPs for the business, which respond to the needs at all times. It also allows you to optimize your daily work, making it more efficient. And sometimes, give a super product to interested stakeholders ðŸ˜‰. So, I have decided to do a certification in this sense, in order to become more professional and competitive tomorrow in my professional environment.

The Google Cloud Professional Data Engineer is for data scientists like me or solution architects, devops engineers and anyone wanting to move into machine learning and data engineering in the context of Google Cloud Platform. Obviously, to start you will need to have some familiarity with the basics of GCP, such as: storage, compute and security; maybe some basic coding skills (like Python); and a good understanding of databases. You do not need to have a background in data engineering or machine learning, but some experience with GCP is essential. This is an advanced certification and I strongly recommend to take the *Google Certified Associate Cloud Engineer* certification before embarking on this path. However, anyone who is motivated and wants to understand how big data and machine learning is done on GCP will still find value with this course.

The certification teaches you how to:

* Design, build and operationalize data solutions
* Process data streams in real-time
* Efficiently store and access data in the cloud
* Use the GCP pre-trained AI APIs (vision, speech and text)
* Train and operationalize ML models.

In short, everything you need to bring added value to your team and **awaken in you**, the potential of cloud skills that in a few years will be indispensable in AI profiles ðŸš€. In the following pages, I will write about this topic. I hope it will be useful for everyone.
