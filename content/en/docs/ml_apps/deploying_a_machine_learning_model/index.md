{{< alert icon="ðŸ’»" context="info" text="<b>TL;DR</b> This tutorial is all about deploying a real machine learning model, and checking what doing so feels like. More concretely, you will deploy a computer vision model trained to detect common objects in pictures." />}}

Deploying a model is one of the last steps in a prototypical machine learning lifecycle. This tutorial uses a pretrained model called [`YOLOV3`](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/). This model is very convenient for two reasons: it runs really fast, and for object detection it yields accurate results.

The sequence of steps/tasks to complete in this tutorial are as follow:
1. Inspect the image data set used for object detection
2. Take a look at the model itself.
3. Deploy the model using [`fastAPI`](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)

## :mag: Object Detection with YOLOV3

### Inspecting the images

Let's take a look at the images that will be passed to the YOLOV3 model. This will bring insight on what type of common objects are present for detection. These images are part of the [`ImageNet`](http://www.image-net.org/index) dataset.


```python
from IPython.display import Image, display
```


```python
# Some example images
image_files = [
    'apple.jpg',
    'clock.jpg',
    'oranges.jpg',
    'car.jpg'
]

for image_file in image_files:
    print(f"\nDisplaying image: {image_file}")
    display(Image(filename=f"images/{image_file}"))
```

    
    Displaying image: apple.jpg
    


    
![jpeg](output_3_1.jpg)
    


    
    Displaying image: clock.jpg
    


    
![jpeg](output_3_3.jpg)
    


    
    Displaying image: oranges.jpg
    


    
![jpeg](output_3_5.jpg)
    


    
    Displaying image: car.jpg
    


    
![jpeg](output_3_7.jpg)
    


### Overview of the model

Now that you have a sense of the image data and the objects present, let's try and see if the model is able to detect and classify them correctly.

For this you will be using [`cvlib`](https://www.cvlib.net/), which is a very simple but powerful library for object detection that is fueled by [`OpenCV`](https://docs.opencv.org/4.5.1/) and [`Tensorflow`](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

More concretely, you will use the [`detect_common_objects`](https://docs.cvlib.net/object_detection/) function, which takes an image formatted as a [`numpy array`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.array.html) and returns:

- `bbox`: list of list containing bounding box coordinates for detected objects. 

    Example:
    ```python
        [[32, 76, 128, 192], [130, 83, 220, 185]]
    ```
    

- `label`: list of labels for detected objects.
    
    Example:
    ```python
        ['apple', 'apple']
    ```


- `conf`: list of confidence scores for detected objects.
    
    Example:
    ```python
        [0.6187325716018677, 0.42835739254951477]
    ```
    
In the next section you will visually see these elements in action.

### Creating the *detect_and_draw_box* function

Before using the object detection model, create a directory where you can store the resulting images:



```python
import os

dir_name = "images_with_boxes"
if not os.path.exists(dir_name):
    os.mkdir(dir_name)
```

Let's define the `detect_and_draw_box` function which takes as input arguments: the **filename** of a file on your system, a **model**, and a **confidence level**. With these inputs, it detects common objects in the image and saves a new image displaying the bounding boxes alongside the detected object.

You might ask yourself why does this function receive the model as an input argument? What models are there to choose from? The answer is that `detect_common_objects` uses the `yolov3` model by default.  However, there is another option available that is much tinier and requires less computational power. 

It is the `yolov3-tiny` version. As the model name indicates, this model is designed for constrained environments that cannot store big models. With this comes a natural tradeoff: the results are less accurate than the full model. However, it still works pretty well. Going forward, we recommend you stick to it since it is a lot smaller than the regular `yolov3` and downloading its pretrained weights takes less time.

The model output is a vector of probabilities for the presence of different objects on the image. The last input argument, confidence level, determines the threshold that the probability needs to surpass to report that a given object is detected on the supplied image. By default, `detect_common_objects` uses a value of 0.5 for this.


```python
import cv2
import cvlib as cv
from cvlib.object_detection import draw_bbox


def detect_and_draw_box(filename, model="yolov3-tiny", confidence=0.5):
    """Detects common objects on an image and creates a new image with bounding boxes.

    Args:
        filename (str): Filename of the image.
        model (str): Either "yolov3" or "yolov3-tiny". Defaults to "yolov3-tiny".
        confidence (float, optional): Desired confidence level. Defaults to 0.5.
    """
    
    # Images are stored under the images/ directory
    img_filepath = f'images/{filename}'
    
    # Read the image into a numpy array
    img = cv2.imread(img_filepath)
    
    # Perform the object detection
    bbox, label, conf = cv.detect_common_objects(img, confidence=confidence, model=model)
    
    # Print current image's filename
    print(f"========================\nImage processed: {filename}\n")
    
    # Print detected objects with confidence level
    for l, c in zip(label, conf):
        print(f"Detected object: {l} with confidence level of {c}\n")
    
    # Create a new image that includes the bounding boxes
    output_image = draw_bbox(img, bbox, label, conf)
    
    # Save the image in the directory images_with_boxes
    cv2.imwrite(f'images_with_boxes/{filename}', output_image)
    
    # Display the image with bounding boxes
    display(Image(f'images_with_boxes/{filename}'))
```

Let's try it out for the example images.


```python
for image_file in image_files:
    detect_and_draw_box(image_file)
```


    ========================
    Image processed: apple.jpg
    
    Detected object: apple with confidence level of 0.5717206597328186
    
    


    
![jpeg](output_10_7.jpg)
    


    ========================
    Image processed: clock.jpg
    
    Detected object: clock with confidence level of 0.9683184623718262
    
    


    
![jpeg](output_10_9.jpg)
    


    ========================
    Image processed: oranges.jpg
    
    Detected object: orange with confidence level of 0.6185588836669922
    
    Detected object: orange with confidence level of 0.5561690330505371
    
    


    
![jpeg](output_10_11.jpg)
    


    ========================
    Image processed: car.jpg
    
    Detected object: car with confidence level of 0.6325406432151794
    
    


    
![jpeg](output_10_13.jpg)
    


## :wrench: Changing the confidence level

Looks like the object detection went fairly well. Let's try it out on a more difficult image containing several objects:


```python
detect_and_draw_box("fruits.jpg")
```

    ========================
    Image processed: fruits.jpg
    
    Detected object: apple with confidence level of 0.5818482041358948
    
    Detected object: orange with confidence level of 0.5346484184265137
    
    Detected object: orange with confidence level of 0.515099287033081
    
    


    
![jpeg](output_12_1.jpg)
    


The **model failed to detect** several fruits and **misclassified** an orange as an apple. This might seem strange since it was able to detect one apple before, so one might think the model has a fair representation on how an apple looks like.

One possibility is that the model **did** detect the other fruits but with a confidence level lower than 0.5. Let's test if  this is a valid hypothesis:


```python
detect_and_draw_box("fruits.jpg", confidence=0.2)
```

    ========================
    Image processed: fruits.jpg
    
    Detected object: apple with confidence level of 0.5818482041358948
    
    Detected object: orange with confidence level of 0.5346484184265137
    
    Detected object: orange with confidence level of 0.515099287033081
    
    Detected object: apple with confidence level of 0.34759870171546936
    
    Detected object: orange with confidence level of 0.32876086235046387
    
    Detected object: apple with confidence level of 0.31244686245918274
    
    Detected object: orange with confidence level of 0.27986079454421997
    
    Detected object: orange with confidence level of 0.2749977707862854
    
    Detected object: apple with confidence level of 0.2744504511356354
    
    Detected object: orange with confidence level of 0.21419058740139008
    
    


    
![jpeg](output_14_1.jpg)
    


By lowering the confidence level the model successfully detects most of the fruits. However, in order to correctly detect the objects present, we had to  set the confidence level really low. In general, you should be careful when decreasing or increasing these kinds of parameters, as changing them might yield undesired results.

As for this concrete example when an orange was misclassified as an apple, it serves as a reminder that these models are not perfect and this should be considered when using them for tasks in production.

## :satellite: Deploying the model using fastAPI


### Placing your object detection model in a server

Now that you know how the model works it is time for you to deploy it! Aren't you excited? :)

Before diving into deployment, let's quickly recap some important concepts and how they translate to `fastAPI`. Let's also create a directory to store the images that are uploaded to the server.



```python
dir_name = "images_uploaded"
if not os.path.exists(dir_name):
    os.mkdir(dir_name)
```

### Some concept clarifications

#### Client-Server model

When talking about **deploying**, what is usually meant is to put all of the software required for predicting in a `server`. By doing this, a `client` can interact with the model by sending `requests` to the server. 

This client-server interaction is out of the scope of this notebook but there are a lot of resources on the internet that you can use to understand it better.

The important thing you need to focus on, is that the Machine Learning model lives in a server waiting for clients to submit prediction requests. The client should provide the required information that the model needs in order to make a prediction. Keep in mind that it is common to batch many predictions in a single request. The server will use the information provided to return predictions to the client, who can then use them at their leisure.

Let's get started by creating an instance of the `FastAPI` class:

```python
app = FastAPI()
```

The next step is using this instance to create endpoints that will handle the logic for predicting (more on this next). Once all the code is in place to run the server you only need to use the command:

```python
uvicorn.run(app)
```

Your API is coded using fastAPI but the serving is done using [`uvicorn`](https://www.uvicorn.org/), which is a really fast Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface (ASGI) implementation. Both technologies are closely interconnected and you don't need to understand the implementation details. Knowing that uvicorn handles the serving is sufficient for the purpose of this lab.

#### Endpoints

You can host multiple Machine Learning models on the same server. For this to work, you can assign a different `endpoint` to each model so you always know what model is being used. An endpoint is represented by a pattern in the `URL`. For example, if you have a website called `myawesomemodel.com` you could have three different models in the following endpoints:

- `myawesomemodel.com/count-cars/`
- `myawesomemodel.com/count-apples/`
- `myawesomemodel.com/count-plants/`

Each model would do what the name pattern suggests.

In fastAPI you define an endpoint by creating a function that will handle all of the logic for that endpoint and [decorating](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0318/) it with a function that contains information on the HTTP method allowed (more on this next) and the pattern in the URL that it will use.

The following example shows how to allow a HTTP GET request for the endpoint "/my-endpoint":

```python
@app.get("/my-endpoint")
def handle_endpoint():
    ...
    ...
```


#### HTTP Requests

The client and the server communicate with each other through a protocol called `HTTP`. The key concept here is that this communication between client and server uses some verbs to denote common actions. Two very common verbs are:

- `GET` -> Retrieves information from the server.
- `POST` -> Provides information to the server, which it uses to respond.

If your client does a `GET request` to an endpoint of a server you will get some information from this endpoint without the need to provide additional information. In the case of a `POST request` you are explicitly telling the server that you will provide some information for it that must be processed in some way.

Interactions with Machine Learning models living on endpoints are usually done via a `POST request` since you need to provide the information that is required to compute a prediction.

Let's take a look at a POST request:

```python
@app.post("/my-other-endpoint")
def handle_other_endpoint(param1: int, param2: str):
    ...
    ...

```

For POST requests, the handler function contains parameters. In contrast with GET, POST requests expect the client to provide some information to it. In this case we supplied two parameters: an integer and a string.


### Why fastAPI?

With fastAPI you can create web servers to host your models very easily. Additionally, this platform is extremely fast and it **has a built-in client that can be used to interact with the server**. To use it you will need to visit the "/docs" endpoint, for this case this means to visit http://localhost:8000/docs. Isn't that convenient?

Enough chatter, let's get going!


```python
import io
import uvicorn
import numpy as np
import nest_asyncio
from enum import Enum
from fastapi import FastAPI, UploadFile, File, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
```


```python
# Assign an instance of the FastAPI class to the variable "app".
# You will interact with your api using this instance.
app = FastAPI(title='Deploying a ML Model with FastAPI')

# List available models using Enum for convenience. This is useful when the options are pre-defined.
class Model(str, Enum):
    yolov3tiny = "yolov3-tiny"
    yolov3 = "yolov3"


# By using @app.get("/") you are allowing the GET method to work for the / endpoint.
@app.get("/")
def home():
    return "Congratulations! Your API is working as expected. Now head over to http://localhost:8000/docs."


# This endpoint handles all the logic necessary for the object detection to work.
# It requires the desired model and the image in which to perform object detection.
@app.post("/predict") 
def prediction(model: Model, file: UploadFile = File(...)):

    # 1. VALIDATE INPUT FILE
    filename = file.filename
    fileExtension = filename.split(".")[-1] in ("jpg", "jpeg", "png")
    if not fileExtension:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=415, detail="Unsupported file provided.")
    
    # 2. TRANSFORM RAW IMAGE INTO CV2 image
    
    # Read image as a stream of bytes
    image_stream = io.BytesIO(file.file.read())
    
    # Start the stream from the beginning (position zero)
    image_stream.seek(0)
    
    # Write the stream of bytes into a numpy array
    file_bytes = np.asarray(bytearray(image_stream.read()), dtype=np.uint8)
    
    # Decode the numpy array as an image
    image = cv2.imdecode(file_bytes, cv2.IMREAD_COLOR)
    
    
    # 3. RUN OBJECT DETECTION MODEL
    
    # Run object detection
    bbox, label, conf = cv.detect_common_objects(image, model=model)
    
    # Create image that includes bounding boxes and labels
    output_image = draw_bbox(image, bbox, label, conf)
    
    # Save it in a folder within the server
    cv2.imwrite(f'images_uploaded/{filename}', output_image)
    
    
    # 4. STREAM THE RESPONSE BACK TO THE CLIENT
    
    # Open the saved image for reading in binary mode
    file_image = open(f'images_uploaded/{filename}', mode="rb")
    
    # Return the image as a stream specifying media type
    return StreamingResponse(file_image, media_type="image/jpeg")
```

By running the following cell you will spin up the server!

This causes the notebook to block (no cells/code can run) until you manually interrupt the kernel. You can do this by clicking on the `Kernel` tab and then on `Interrupt`. You can also enter Jupyter's command mode by pressing the `ESC` key and tapping the `I` key twice.


```python
# Allows the server to be run in this interactive environment
nest_asyncio.apply()

# Host depends on the setup you selected (docker or virtual env)
host = "0.0.0.0" if os.getenv("DOCKER-SETUP") else "127.0.0.1"

# Spin up the server!    
uvicorn.run(app, host=host, port=8000)
```

    INFO:     127.0.0.1:58232 - "POST /predict?model=yolov3-tiny HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
    

The server is now running! Head over to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see it in action.

**Try submitting an image** and see how your API is able to detect objects within it and return a new image containing the bounding boxes alongside the labels of the detected objects. **You can do this by  visiting [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) to open fastAPI's built-in client.**
