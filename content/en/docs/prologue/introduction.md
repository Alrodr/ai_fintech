## :books: Why Data Doks

Here you will find a list of all the notes that I have been creating for my personal use over the last few years, while studying and deepening the deployment of AI solutions in enterprises. All the documents you will find below are a personal notes. I try to explain the most important concepts from a practical point of view, but I do not go deeper than can be found in a book. For that, there are already books üìö


## üß† Why AI and Cloud Computing

The Cloud has empowered organizations' businesses by providing them with flexibility, agility, scalability and the possibility of making significant savings. Most people today know the benefits of the Cloud computing model, what it is and how it works. But combined with artificial intelligence (AI), it is the perfect combo to drive business, leverage the value of data and deliver intuitive experiences to customers or users.

When we talk about AI in this case, we are referring to technologies that make up some of its subfields, such as statistics, machine and deep learning, which drive the most dynamic applications, such as predictive analytics, natural language processing and computer vision.

For some time now, these AI tools have been used to add more value and increase the functionalities of existing cloud computing platforms. With AI technologies mounted on top of Cloud computing infrastructures, organizations can, as we said, better manage their data, find valuable information for business decision making and optimize the efficiency of their operational circuits. 

Arguably, the Cloud facilitates a "democratization" of AI capabilities and benefits by enabling access to large and small players alike, primarily through solutions offered as a service that have embedded artificial intelligence. Indeed: large corporate software vendors have already integrated AI capabilities into their Cloud-based solutions and brought them to the mass market. By integrating with the IT infrastructure, artificial intelligence facilitates the self-management of Cloud environments: it enables workflows to be automated - freeing up staff to tackle tasks that add more value - and improves load management.
